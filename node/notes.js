// Node really just lets us write JS outside of the browser
// node .\somefilepath - this runs javascript outside of the browser
// If you don't specify a file, but you run a "folder", it will look for an index.js file and run it
// Regular javascript browser APIs don't exist in node prompt, alert, confirm, document......

// process.argv always returns an array
// The first 2 elements are hardcoded
// FIrst element is where node is installed
// second element is the location of the file you ran

// npm init -y (npm = node package manager)
