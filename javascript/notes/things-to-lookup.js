// The four rules of this
    // By defaut, if this is not referencing an object, it returns the window object
    // The 4 different cases of this?
        // 4 - this means window
        // 3 - this means inside object
        // 2 -
        // 1 -

// Different types architecture and protocols of APIs
    // REST
    // FAST
    // SOAP
    // XML-RPC
    // JSON-RPC

// Main types of Web APIs
    // Open APIs
    // Partner APIs
    // Internal APIs
    // Composite APIs
        // These are all just who these APIs are available to
        // For now we will need to use open source APIs

// What is Ajax?
    // It is a call you use when working with an API (will be useful for weather dashboard)
    // Where you use the url associated with the API (mostly every web api call)
    // Seems fairly similar to the 'WebClient' proxy in C#
    // This is done with Jquery -- $ means Jquery ( a faster and easier way to write javascript )

// What is a proxy?
    // The intermediary between users and websites they are looking at, a sort of messenger for your request
    // This 'messenger' will contain authentication other parameters.

// With browser APIs, are we just talking about APIs specific to the browser? Like Chrome, Firefox, etc.
    // yes ^^

// For project 1 use materialize

// Look up elements and nodes and whatnot
