# Cannot start with number, no spaces, no special symbols
# Names should be lowercase (besides consts)
# Avoid built in key words
# Python uses dynamic typing, you can reassign variable to different data types NOT A STRICT TYPE LANGUAGE
my_dog = 2
my_dog = "Sammy"

# Can reassign variables using themselves
a = 10
a = 2*a # a is now 20

# Type function can return variable types
type(a) # Returns int
